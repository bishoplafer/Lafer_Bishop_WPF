// Dogs age seven times faster than humans. If Sparky is 4 years old in human years how old is he in dog years?
var humanYears = 4; // declare humanYears variable and define it as 4 (This is Sparky's age in human years
var dogYears = humanYears * 7; // declare dogYears variable and define it as 7 times humanYears (This is Sparky's age in dog years)
console.log("Sparky is " + humanYears + " years old, which is " + dogYears + " in dog years");
